# metadelta-js
**A small library for advanced math.**  
### What is it?
Metadelta is an intuitive library that makes performing advanced mathematical operations much simpler. It can be used in anything from factoring a polynomial expression to calculating the area under a curve.

### Why this?
Doing advanced math with Javascript takes an exceptional amount of time and knowledge that could be used to do so many other things (like building the next big thing). Metadelta removes the worry for a powerful math library by abstracting various mathematical concepts and operations to make developers' lives easier.

### How do I get started?
To add Metadelta to your project, simply run the following line in your project's root directory.
```
npm install --save metadelta
```
That's it! Now you can begin implementing Metadelta's powerful functionality in your project.

### No, where are the docs?
Oh, Metadelta's documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/aunyks/metadelta-js/blob/master/DOCS.md).
